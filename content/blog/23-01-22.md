### HERBS 

Herbs like ginseng, ginger root, gotukola and malunggay strengthen and support weak tissues.

They are naturally occurring sources of nutrition in the form of VITAMINS, MINERAL, ENZYMES and important intrinsic factors combined in such a way that they are BALANCED and respond rapidly in the body.  As catalysts, essential nutrients are readily assimilated by our body.

GINSENG root, a traditional oriental medicine, contains more than a dozen of biologically active saponins called ginsenosides. Tests have found 17 amino acids which reach their peak point during the sprouting season in April.

POLYSACCHARIDES from the root of ginseng have shown considerable dose-dependent immunological,  phagocytic and anti-complement properties.

MALUNGGAY, known scientifically as MORINGA OLEIFERA is one of the world’s most useful plants.  

It is used as food, effective flocculant (water treatment), antibiotic and a source of oil.  100 grams or 1 cup of cooked malunggay leaves contains 3.1g protein, 0.6g fiber, 96mg calcium, 29mg phosphorus, 1.7mg iron, 2.820mg B-carotene, 0.07mg thiamine, 0.14mg riboflavin, 1.1mg niacin and 53mg ascorbic acid (VIT C).

Malunggay leaves are an excellent source of Vitamin A and B and minerals such as calcium and iron.  It is even an excellent source of protein, being higher than the AMINO ACID pattern of FAO – reference protein yet contains very low fat and CHO.  The leaves are incomparable as a source of the sulfur containing AA methionine and cysteine, often the natural minerals human lack.

Malunggay contains high levels of beta-carotene, Vitamin C and E and the phytochemical NIAZIMININ. These substances are potent antioxidants that protect cells of the body from getting damaged by free radicals. -->

100 grams of Malunggay leaves powder contains the following:

Nutrient | Amount
--- | ---
Protein | 46.4 g
Ash | 11.5 g
Beta-carotene | 45,172 μg
Calcium | 1.3g
Iron | 5.7 mg
Zinc | 3.4 mg


<!-- The fruit powder contained 4.1±0.1 mg iron, 3.2±0.0 mg zinc and 0.4±0.0 g calcium per 100 g. Phytic acid (368±06 -576±72 mg/100 g sample) and tannic acid (1280±24-1956±09 mg/100 g) from leaves and fruits were high. All products were good sources of total (24.3±0.2-39.9±0.2 g/100g), insoluble (19.6±0.2-34.9±0.2 g/100g) and soluble (3.1±0.2-5.0±0.2 g/100g) dietary fiber. Zinc availability (59.5±0.1-93.8±0.1%) from malunggay leaves was significantly greater than that of calcium (25.0±0.1-53.8± 0.2%) and iron (7.0±0.1-19.5±0.1%; (P<0.05). Similar trend was observed from malunggay fruit. Dietary fiber fermentation of malunggay leaves produced short chain fatty acids, propionate (161.8±5.0-210.7±13.1 mg/g) > acetate (1.4±0.1 - 21.7±0.1 mg/g) > butyrate (3.0±0.1-7.7±2.3 mg/g; P<0.05). -->


Free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen are highly reactive atoms or groups of atoms that are by-products of the normal metabolic activities of cells.  They serve a useful purpose in the body because they are able to help kill bacteria and other harmful microorganisms.  

But in excess, they injure cells.  They oxidize proteins and lipids that are inside the cell and damage the nucleus.

Free radicals are believed to contribute to such chronic degenerative diseases and many other conditions associated with AGEING.  Among lactating mothers, malunggay is well-known for its high calcium content and ability to increase the flow of milk.

MALUNGGAY is called a ‘miracle vegetable’ because it is NOT just a food; it is also a medicine.  It may therefore be a ‘FUNCTIONAL FOOD.’
