Biochemic Salts, also known as tissue salts, was developed by Dr William H. Schuessler, a German physician, in the late 1800’s. 

He recognized that the twelve of the inorganic salts found in us have specific physiologic functions. He maintained that these tissue salts or ‘cell salts’ are vital mineral constituents of the body. They combine with organic substances in the body to produce and maintain the infinite number of cells and tissues of which the human body is composed. Thus, any cell salt deficiency or imbalance may result in an illness and manifestations of a set of symptoms in body. Dr. Schuessler found that if the body was lacking in any of these salts, loss of health occurred. And if this deficiency was corrected with homeopathically (micro-doses) preparation of these salts, the body could in fact, heal itself.Schuessler Salts are inorganic minerals found in nature as a salt. 

They form part of the composition of the earth and are listed in the Periodic Table. Minerals in the body conduct energy much like electric wires carry current and a lack of current or energy causes weakness or failure of affected cells. Dr. Schuessler was originally a homeopath but eventually distanced himself from homeopathy because of the unmanageable amount of medications it offered. He developed “Biochemistry according to Schuessler”. 

As per his theory most illnesses are based on a disturbance of the mineral balance in the body. A deficiency of minerals in the body has an effect on the overall metabolism. However, the aim of the Schuessler Salts is not to supply the body with the deficient minerals. The Schuessler Salts are meant to stimulate the human body to improve the absorption of the lacking minerals from ingested food.

It is important to note that the Schuessler Biochemic Tissue Salts are NOT drugs, but valuable micro-dose mineral cell foods prepared homeopathically in a form which ensures rapid and easy assimilation, for the speedy restoration of the natural balance of the body system.
